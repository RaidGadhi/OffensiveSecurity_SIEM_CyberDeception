📖 Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a hands-on project exploring offensive security techniques, cyber deception using honeypots, and data visualization with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform.
It demonstrates methods to simulate and analyze cyber-attacks while offering defense strategies.

🚀 Features
Reconnaissance & Exploitation: Automated attack scripts using tools like Nmap, Gobuster, Hydra, and SQLmap.
Honeypot Deployment: Glastopf honeypot setup to mimic HTTP vulnerabilities.
SIEM Integration: Visualization and analysis of attack data using Wazuh.
Defense Mechanisms: Dynamic IP blocking, rate limiting, and SQL injection detection scripts.
